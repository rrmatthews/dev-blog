Last week, my friend and fellow Civic Digital Fellow Andrew Chou reached out to me about meeting up to get started on some personal site / blog development. Now if you don't know (and unless you already knew Andrew you wouldn't), Andrew is man when it comes to side projects and emerging development tools. I mean homie's Twitter feed is him trying out like 6 new technologies a week. I don't know how he does it! Anyways, he suggested we try out this simple static site generator called [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). 

So we met up in Cambridge at Black Sheep Bagel Café; a great spot if you've never been! With some gourmet bagel sandwiches in hand, we sat down and went straight to the Eleventy docs for tutorials: 
- [MAKING A SIMPLE WEB SITE WITH THE SIMPLEST STATIC SITE GENERATOR, LEVEL 1](https://www.zachleat.com/web/eleventy-tutorial-level-1/)
- [MAKING A SIMPLE WEB SITE WITH THE SIMPLEST STATIC SITE GENERATOR, LEVEL 2—ADDING FILTERS](https://www.zachleat.com/web/eleventy-tutorial-level-2/)
- [Build your own Blog from Scratch using Eleventy](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/build-a-blog/)

And after about an hour of Andrew breezing through it all, and me complaining that the tutorials were unclear, we had created small static sites with Eleventy. And actually, while I was going through all this, I realized why I had this anxiety if you will around trying new side projects and technologies: I always felt like the tutorials were never for complete beginners. And why would they be? Computer Science is a field where once you something thoroughly with one language or technology, learning the others is pretty easy. It's just a matter of syntax. But if you're not confident in some of the smaller nuances that aren't necessarily taught in schools (for example: NPM, CommandLine), you're in for a rocky start whenever you want to start something new. But that's probably going to become it's own post where I talk about how I would personally like to see tutorials / learning guides written.

Anyways, that last tutorial actually linked us to a [starter blog repo](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) which we eventually just used as the base for our individual projects. And for me, that is this blog! So even though today was only the start, I have some basic plans for this guy.

## The Future of This Thing

This blog is going to be where I write about my experiences making my side projects and my journey to becoming the software engineer I hope to be. In terms of the technical aspects of this blog, well...it's basically done. Maybe I'll make some basic UI tweaks to colors and things, but it's basically everything I need. Oh and figure out how to get the RSS feed on here because that sounds dope. And at the time of writing this, I still need to host this bad boy somewhere. We're gonna try Github Pages again, but Andrew wants me to try Netlify, so maybe I'll do that.

Until next post, homies.
